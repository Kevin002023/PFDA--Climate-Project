# **PFDA--Climate-Project**
By Kevin O'Leary

This repository is my submission for the module Programming for Data Analysis as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing and Data Analytics at Atlantic Technological University.

# Contents of Repository
- This Readme file
- project.ipynb notebook which contains all of the research, analysis and plots formed.
- a .gitignore file to ignore any temporary files and folders that should not normally be committed to a repository
- Datasets Used Folder- A folder containing all of the datasets I have sourced elsewhere for analysis
- New Datasets - A folder containing any new datasets I have formed by stitching data from different sources together.

# Project Instruction

An analysis of paleo-present climate data
  - Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present.
  - Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)
  - Examine Irish context:
  - Climate change signals: (see Maynooth study: The emergence of a climate change signal in long-term Irish meteorological observations - ScienceDirect)
  - Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas dataframe and export to csv and json formats
  - For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).
  - Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue
  - Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature)

# How to download this repository

- Download Anaconda.
- Download VsCode or use JupyterNotebook via browser (https://jupyter.org/try).
- Clone the repository from https://github.com/Kevin002023/FODA.
- Open via VsCode or JupyterNotebooks.
- Software Used
  -  This project was done on Jupyter Notebooks using Python 3.11.15. on the editor Visual Studio Code V 1.75.1. It was used to produce both the code and this README.md file.
